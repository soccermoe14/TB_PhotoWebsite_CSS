    <p class="two">Taylor Brouillard has lived in Northwest Arkansas since 2017. He discovered his love for photography when he was introduced to his family's property on Beaver Lake. 
    Before long, he was carrying his camera with him everywhere! From birth, Taylor has been an animal person. All animals adore him and he loves them just as much! 
     Combining his love for photography and affinity with pets, he grew his entrepreneurial skills and began his first business.
    Today, Taylor is well known in the Northwest Arkansas photography community and he continues to grow his career; now branching into the film industry!</p1>
